		<h1 class="thd_title">What everyone should know</h1>
		<p class="thd_text">Would you be able to defend yourself and your loved ones if someone were to physically attack you? It’s a question most of us don’t want to consider, but violence is, unfortunately, a fact of life. Here’s how to prepare for and stay safe in common real-world violent situations.</p>
		<h2>Prevention Is the Best Self-Defense</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">First, Attackers, whatever their objectives, are looking for unsuspecting, vulnerable targets. So be sure be aware of your surroundings, only walking and parking in well-lit areas, keeping your keys in hand as you approach your door or car, varying your route and times of travel, and other personal security precautions.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Apart from avoiding confrontation, if you can defuse a situation (talk someone down from physically assaulting you) or get away—by handing over your wallet/purse or whatever they want, do that. Hand over your money rather than fight. Nothing you own isworth more than your life or health.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">If violence is unavoidable, however, to really defend yourself, you’ll want to know ahead of time how to fight back effectively—it’s possible even against someone bigger or stronger than you.</p>

	<div id="art2" class="thd_content">
		<h1 class="thd_title">Things you should never do after a self-defense shooting</h1>
		<p class="thd_text">When it comes to armed self-defense, it's usually not the shooting itself that trips you up legally. More often than not, it's what you do afterward that gets you in hot water.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Here are the things you should avoid after using your gun in self defense. Never ...</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Call the police in a panic. No matter how tough you are, your body and brain will bea mess after you pull the trigger and see a body lying on your living room floor. Take a moment to breath deeply, calm down, and get your thoughts in order before you call authorities. Consider learning 4-square breathing to relax.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Leave the scene. Unless you're in danger, stay put. You may feel an overwhelming need to seek out friends or family or run away, but don't. That could be misinterpreted as fleeing the scene which could give the appearance of guilt.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Move or tamper with evidence. It's natural to want to "tidy up," especially if you're in your home. This is unwise. Touch nothing. If there are others nearby, make sure they do the same.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Have your gun in your hand when the police arrive. Police will be responding to a "man with a gun" or "shots fired" call and won't know who's the good guy and who'sthe bad guy. They will view anyone holding a gun as a threat and will deal with you as such. In short, reholster your gun or set it down if you don't want to get shot.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Make a statement to police before you talk to your lawyer. Police have a job to do and you need to be cooperative, but you don't want to say too much because anything you say will be used against you.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Fall for good cop bad cop. You think you're too smart to fall for this routine, but you're not. You'll be upset and you'll want to talk, especially to anyone who appears sympathetic. Talk to your lawyer before you make any statement to police.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Try your case on the spot. Police have more than one way to get you to talk. Aside from good cop bad cop, they might challenge your use of lethal force. You'll want toargue your case, but don't.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Lecture police on the law or your rights. The worst things you can do is get belligerent or act superior. Police are human beings and will react like anyone else ifyou challenge their authority, belittle their intelligence, or talk down to them. No matter what police say, even if they say or do something you believe to be incorrect,this isn't the time to get into a debate.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Fail to use the word "sir." Most police are good, decent people who have a difficult job. Treat them with respect. Phrases such as "yes sir" and "no sir" will go a long way toward showing responding officers that you are the respectable, upstanding citizen you know yourself to be.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Be surprised if you're treated like a criminal. It's best to assume that you will be handcuffed, placed prone on the ground, locked in the back of a cruiser, or even jailed. It takes time to sort out the truth of any shooting, and police are likely to do any or all of these things. Don't take it personally. Don't resist or argue. Cooperate fully and just let it all happen. Of course, if you're a member of Second Call Defense, you'll have immediate help to sort things out. But even if you're not, take itall in stride.</p>

But even if you're not, take itall in stride.Article 3Claims that self-defense can only be under specific circumstancesSelf-defense is a legally recognized justification for committing an act that would ordinarily be considered as a crime such as killing or injuring a person, you should know that the law requires the presence of specific circumstances before it can be availed of as a proper legal defense. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines (RPC) provides that:“Art. 11. Justifying circumstances. – The following do not incur any criminal liability:</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided the following circumstances concur:</p>
		<p class="thd_text">First. Unlawful aggression;</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Second. Reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it;</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Third. Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.”</p>
		<p class="thd_text">First, one of the circumstances that is required to be present to avail the defense of self-defense is the presence of unlawful aggression. The Supreme Court elaborated on this matter in one of its decisions, which states that:</p>
		<p class="thd_text">“A person who invokes self-defense has the burden of proof of proving all the elements. However, the most important among all the elements is the element of unlawful aggression. Unlawful aggression must be proved first in order for self-defense to be successfully pleaded, whether complete or incomplete. As this court said in People v. Catbagan, “There can be no self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, unless the victim had committed unlawful aggression against the person who resorted to self-defense.”</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Unlawful aggression is an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury, upon a person. In case of threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the wrongful intent to cause injury.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Second, the requirement of reasonable necessity of the means used to defend one’s self from an unlawful aggression entails the use of reasonable means of self- defense that is commensurate to the nature and the extent of the attack sought to be averted And whetherthe means employed is reasonable depends on the nature and quality of the weapon used by the aggressor, his physical condition, character, size and other circumstances, and those of the person defending himself, and also the place and the occasion of the assault Third, the law requires that the person claiming self-defense should not have given sufficient provocation for the victim to attack or commit aggression against the former. Once all of these are proven before the court, then you and your wife may use self-defense as a legal justification to avoid criminal liability.</p>

		<p class="thd_text">Most attacks on women are happening in the home.</p>

		<h1 class="thd_title">Arming Yourself of Self-Defense</h1>
		<p class="thd_text">There are many resources in the Jackson metro area for women to learn how to get out of a dangerous situation.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Initially the self-defense class was just something fun to do with girlfriends, but now it has turned into a full hobby.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"What we learn are very simple and easy techniques that anybody can really do you don't have to be tough, you don't have to fight. He just teaches you to get out of situations,” Rodriguez explained.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">If someone does attack, and grabs your arm, first move - turn towards the thumb.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">The most sensitive spots on a person are the eyes, nose, groin, solar plexus and the throat.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Conway says a great move to attack some of those areas is the elbow strike.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">You can use your keys as a weapon. Always carry one of the key rings around your middle finger. If someone attacks, use those keys to do the next move, the palm heel strike.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"Palm heel is when you push them straight in the face using the palm of your hand,” Conway said. "So you're trying to hit them in the nose, right there and when you do that something might get in their eye and scratch them, skin and stuff on it.”</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"It's an automatic habit now to make sure I carry my keys before coming out to the store and going to my car,” said Rodriguez.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">You can also protect yourself by packing heat.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"When I get up it's part of like putting on my watch," said Kim Condon, who is the chapter president for the Clinton-Raymond Chapter of Well-Armed Woman, an organization aimed to teach women how to shoot. They contract services from Boondocks Firearms Training Academy. Condon is also NRA certified.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"Treat them all as if they are loaded. Keep your finger off the trigger when you're manipulating your gun, when you're choosing your gun until you're ready to fire, know what your target is," Condon explained.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Condon, who's been professionally shooting for 2.5 years, says with the proper training, being armed is the best way to protect yourself.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"Women to me need to start out with a smaller caliber type gun like a 22. So that you don't get the recoil," said Condon.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">She taught our reporter, Annette Peagler, some of the basics. Then Peagler put those skillsto the test.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"A lot of women are scared of the gun, but the gun is not what kills you it's the person who has it," said Officer Brad Burns with the Clinton Police Department.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Burns, who also teaches self-defense classes, encourages women to get some type of firearms training. Burns also says there are things you can do now to prevent you from being a target to criminals.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">"People have been watched, they know where they are going, they know when they leavethe house, and they know coming home they know all this stuff. Change it up a little bit, change your times, your routines, your routes," Burns explained.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">The best thing to do is to trust your instincts, and get some type of training like Rodriguez, you never know when you'll be in a life or death situation.</p>

		<h1 class="thd_title">Simple self defense moves that could protect you in street crime</h1>
		<p class="thd_text">Street crime is on the increase with more muggings than ever taking place up and down the country.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Statistics from the British Crime Survey 2002 reveal street robberies soared 28 per cent last year. But according to the Metropolitan Police, your risk of attack can be cut simply by following some basic personal safety measures.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">Apart from walking in well-lit streets and being aware of your surroundings, self defence experts recommend carrying a personal alarm and learning some simple self defence moves in case an attacker strikes</p>
		<p class="thd_text"><i>To help you feel safer on the streets, view our picture gallery, right, to learn some basic self defence moves. Read our guide below to find out what's involved. Also, view our second picture gallery, right, to find out which personal alarm is best for you.</i></p>
		<h2>WALK CONFIDENTLY</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">The first rule when it comes to safety on the street is to walk confidently. Psychiatrists have found that speaking the right body language such as looking alert and confident willmake attackers think twice about approaching you.</p>
		<p class="thd_text">The truth is that most attackers will look for someone who is easily frightened and appears to be an easy target. 'One of the best tricks is to walk confidently,' says self defence expert John Davies of Basis Training UK, an organisation that teaches self defence classes. 'Get into the habit of walking positively with your head tall, rather than walking with slumped shoulders and looking at the floor.'</p>
		<h2>SCRAPE YOUR HEEL DOWN THE SIDE OF HIS SHIN</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">If you are approached from behind, one of the most effective ways to throw off your attacker is to run your heel down the front of their shin - the prominent bone found in the lower part of the leg. This is a fine bone and even if your attacker is well built, this bone tends to stick out. Simply lift up your heel and scrape your heel down the front of your assailant's shin bone as hard as possible. Most footwear is capable of causing pain and damage, but heels are even better.</p>
		<h2>AIM FOR THE NOSE</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">If your attacker grabs you from behind, another tactic is to throw your head back as far aspossible and try to head butt your assailant's nose. You should try to jerk your head back - being careful not to jar your own neck - and aim for the bridge of his nose. The theory is that your attacker releases you in order to grab hold of his painful nose - giving you vital seconds to run away.</p>
		<h2>GO FOR THE EYE</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">If your attacker is heading towards you, grab his ear with your fingers and press your thumb firmly along the whole of his eye. Use a pushing action, press your thumb back into his skull. Holding your attacker's ear means your thumb will automatically drop down to his eye level. Apart from being more painful than simply poking his eye, if your assailant turns his head, your hand will move with it. With any luck, your attacker will jerk backwards in an attempt to cover his eye, giving you precious time to flee.</p>
		<h2>AIM FOR THE THROAT</h2>
		<p class="thd_text">Self defence experts also recommend poking your finger into your attacker's windpipe - the part of the air passage found below the Adam's apple. Try to press your finger - rather than your thumb - into the space between the Adam's apple and the top of the breastbone as hard as possible. Pressing your finger into this part of the body is easier to do. This hasthe effect of closing the air passage making it difficult for your attacker to breathe. The idea is that he will clasp his throat in order to breathe again, allowing you the chance to escape.</p>
		<h2>KEEP YOUR KEYS HANDY</h2>
